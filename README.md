## Meta Existiential Paradigm

The Meta Existential Paradigm is a framework for exploring the nature of existence.
I wanted to show off some of my basic HTMl knowledge and skills by making this. 
Some of the code was already made by me before, hence why I was able to complete this quickly, I just reused it.
Hopefully this is impressive enough!
